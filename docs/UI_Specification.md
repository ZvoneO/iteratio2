= SPEC-001: Generic UI Specification for Data Management
:sectnums:
:toc:


== Background

To maintain consistency in the user interface design across different modules, the UI for managing structured data must follow a standardized approach. The goal is to enhance usability while ensuring a visually cohesive design across all management interfaces.

== Requirements

*Must Have:*
- Each data entry should be represented as a collapsible line item. 
- Content of line item depends on data table it display. 
- Display the elements for each data line as defined, add Actions aligned to the right (Edit and Delete icons only)
- Clicking the edit icon expands/collapses additional details.
- Display a list of associated elements when expanded with edit/add/delete options as icons.
- Each associated element should be represented as a label-value pair with:
  - Trash icon for deletion
  - '+' icon for adding a new element
- A standalone '+' icon should be located below the list of entries for adding a new entry.
- "SAVE" icon collapses the expanded view and updates the list.

*Should Have:*
- Smooth expand/collapse animations for better UX.
- Validation on the Name field to prevent empty submissions.
- Consistent spacing and layout alignment across all UI elements.

*Could Have:*
- Drag-and-drop reordering of entries.
- Inline editing of associated elements without opening a modal.

*Won't Have:*
- Text labels for Edit and Delete icons (icons only for a cleaner UI).

== Method

To implement the above requirements, the UI will be structured using template-based rendering. Below is the proposed UI hierarchy:

title Data Management UI Structure

component "Data List" {
  [Data Entry Row] --> [Associated Elements List]
  [Associated Elements List] --> [Element Item]
}

[Data Entry Row] -right-> [Actions (Edit/Delete Icons)]
[Associated Elements List] -down-> [Add Element (+ Icon)]

[+ Icon (Add Entry)] --> [Add Entry Form]
[Add Entry Form] -down-> [Element Management]
[SAVE Icon] --> [Collapse & Update List]

@enduml
----

- The **Data List** displays all entries.
- Each **Data Entry Row** includes the entry details and actions.
- Clicking the Edit icon expands the **Associated Elements List**.
- The **Associated Elements List** shows existing elements with delete options and an add button.
- The **+ Icon** below the list expands a form for adding a new entry.
- The **SAVE Icon** collapses the expanded view and updates the list.

== Implementation

1. **Define Template Components:**
   - A base template that includes the layout and styling.
   - A template for rendering the list of data entries.
   - A template for each data row displaying name, description, count, and actions.
   - A template for managing associated elements within each entry.
   - A template for adding new entries and elements.

2. **Implement Expand/Collapse Behavior:**
   - Use client-side scripting to handle UI interactions for expanding and collapsing entries.

3. **Handle Add/Edit/Delete Operations:**
   - Implement form submissions for editing, adding, and deleting entries and elements.
   - Ensure data updates are properly handled and reflected in the UI.

4. **Styling & Layout:**
   - Ensure alignment and consistency of all elements across Application.
   - Keep actions aligned to the right for clarity.

This specification ensures a structured and reusable UI approach for managing various sets of data in a consistent manner.
