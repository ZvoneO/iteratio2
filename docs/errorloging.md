##How to Use the New Error Handling System

Checking Logs for Errors:
# View all ERROR logs
   python scripts/check_logs.py --level ERROR
   
   # View recent errors
   python scripts/check_logs.py --level ERROR --hours 24
   
   # Search for specific errors
   python scripts/check_logs.py --contains "updating user"
   
   
**Debugging Process:**
1. Check the admin.log file for detailed error information
2. Look for ERROR level messages related to user updates
3. Examine the stack trace to identify the source of the error
4. Check the browser console for additional client-side error details
**Fixing the Current Error:**
The specific error should now be logged in the admin.log file
The error details are also displayed in the browser console
The UI now shows a more detailed error message
These improvements provide a robust foundation for error handling and debugging in the application, making it easier to identify and fix issues like the user update error you encountered.


<div class="accordion-header d-flex align-items-center py-1 px-2" id="group-heading-5-1">
                                                <
ALP I, Adizes Leadership Program I and *** should all be in one line


Check code for errors- Check errors in @admin.log and @consultants.log .
1. One is written in log (ProductElement Object has no attribute 'name'. Cannot set properties of null (setting 'textContent') . 
2. UI adaptation - When showing expertise, class="group-heading mb-2", class="text-muted small mb-1" and  class="d-flex align-items-center mb-2" should all be in one line.
3. UI adaptation - class="d-flex align-items-center mb-2" is missing text - element name and element activity from Product groups. 
4. button class="btn btn-sm btn-primary save-expertise"  when pressed, it should save data to database, collapse Expertise settings, write to log and display feedback message about correct process.

#Potential Issues:
Transaction Handling Issues:

Some parts of the code perform db.session.commit() without explicit exception handling.
Example:
db.session.commit()
If a commit fails, the transaction might leave the session in an invalid state.
Suggestion: Use a context manager for database transactions, which you've implemented as db_transaction(), but isn't consistently applied across all functions.

Failure to Check for Existing Entries Before Insertion:

The ensure_consultant_entries() method inserts new Consultant records but does not check for duplicate entries properly:
python
Copy
Edit
existing_consultant = Consultant.query.filter_by(user_id=user.id).first()
if not existing_consultant:
    new_consultant = Consultant(
        user_id=user.id,
        status='Active',
        availability_days_per_month=0
    )
    db.session.add(new_consultant)
If the Consultant table has constraints (like a unique index on user_id), this could fail when a duplicate is inserted.
Fix: Add a database constraint at the model level or use db.session.merge() instead of db.session.add().
Rolling Back Changes Incorrectly:

In manage_consultant(), if an error occurs, you perform:

python
Copy
Edit
db.session.rollback()
but then continue execution, leading to potential inconsistent states.

Fix: Log the error before rollback, and avoid executing further logic after a rollback.

JSON Field Updates in update_consultant_expertise():

This function modifies the custom_data JSON field in the database.
If custom_data is stored in a column of type JSON, and you're modifying a nested dictionary inside it, some ORM systems (e.g., SQLAlchemy) require explicit db.session.commit() after modifying JSON fields, as they donâ€™t trigger an automatic update.
Fix: Ensure explicit db.session.commit() after modifying consultant.custom_data.

Consultant Role Handling Issue:

In delete_consultant(), you remove the Consultant record but only check if the user has other consultant records before removing the Consultant role:
python
Copy
Edit
other_consultants = Consultant.query.filter_by(user_id=user_id).count()
if other_consultants == 0 and consultant_role in user.roles:
    user.roles.remove(consultant_role)
If removing a role requires explicit database updates, you might need an explicit db.session.commit() after modifying the user.roles relationship.
Next Steps
To identify the exact issue, I need:

Any error logs or traceback messages from the application (especially from db.session.commit() failures).
Database schema for Consultant, User, and related tables to check constraints.
Would you like to enable logging of db.session.commit() failures to capture more details?
