How to Use the New Error Handling System
Checking Logs for Errors:
Debugging Process:
Check the admin.log file for detailed error information
Look for ERROR level messages related to user updates
Examine the stack trace to identify the source of the error
Check the browser console for additional client-side error details
Fixing the Current Error:
The specific error should now be logged in the admin.log file
The error details are also displayed in the browser console
The UI now shows a more detailed error message
These improvements provide a robust foundation for error handling and debugging in the application, making it easier to identify and fix issues like the user update error you encountered.
